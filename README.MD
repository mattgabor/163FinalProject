# The Dangerous Road Ahead
### By Jason Blevins, Matt Gabor, and Hide Shidara

This interactive information interface contains a map and three visualizations. To navigate to the other visualizations, you can scroll or use the navigation bar at the top of the page. Two states can be selected at a time. Default states are selected but can be changed. To select a different state, click on one of the selected states to de-select it and choose a new state for comparison. States can also be changed in the drop-down menus and changes will be reflected in the other visualizations as well as the map.
